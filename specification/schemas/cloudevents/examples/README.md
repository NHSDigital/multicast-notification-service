Signal examples generated using `make signal-examples`

They take the `example` property of the signal schemas in the parent directory and output them as JSON.

We provide direct links to these from the Signal Catalogue so consumers can see what they look easily.

Will be made obselete by a better signal schema viewer (renderer) for the Signal Catalogue
